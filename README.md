# Hydroponics
Welcome to the Hydroponics Project!

This is a simple beginner-level project that demonstrates the basics of hydroponics, an innovative method of growing plants without soil. Unlike traditional farming, hydroponics uses a nutrient-rich water solution to deliver essential elements directly to the plant roots.

How to Use
_Explore the Code: Take a look at the provided code files to understand how the hydroponics system works.
_Make Modifications: This project was created as a learning exercise. Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to understand different aspects of hydroponics.
_Run the Project: Execute the main script to see the hydroponics system in action.

Note:
_Please note that this project is meant for learning purposes, and you are encouraged to update the code yourself to enhance your understanding of hydroponics and programming.
_For a more comprehensive hydroponics project that includes nutrient management and advanced features, you may want to explore other resources or create your own extensions to this project.
