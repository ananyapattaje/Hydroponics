Install Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website.
> Visit the Arduino Website:
    Open your web browser and go to the official Arduino website at https://www.arduino.cc/
> Navigate to the Software Page:
    On the Arduino website, hover over the "Software" tab in the top menu and click on "Downloads" from the dropdown menu.
> Choose Your Operating System:
    Depending on whether you're using Windows, macOS, or Linux, select the appropriate version of the Arduino IDE.
> Download the Installer:
    Click on the download link for your operating system. The website should automatically detect your operating system and provide the correct download link.
> Install the Arduino IDE:
    Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded file (it's typically a .zip file for Windows and macOS, and a .tar.xz or .tar.gz file for Linux) and extract it.
> Install Drivers:
    Depending on your Arduino board, you may need to install drivers. For most Arduino boards like Uno, Mega, etc., the drivers are included with the Arduino IDE. However, for newer boards or specific USB-to-serial converters, you may need to install drivers separately. Follow the instructions provided by your board's manufacturer.
> Board Manager Setup:
    If you're using a non-standard Arduino board, you might need to add board definitions via the Board Manager. Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for your board's manufacturer, and install the appropriate package.
> Library Manager Setup:
    Arduino IDE allows you to easily install additional libraries via the Library Manager. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries... and search for libraries you want to install.
