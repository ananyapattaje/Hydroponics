CONNECTIONS:

Connections for ESP8266 with Blynk (NodeMCU):

Motor: Connect one terminal to pin D2 (GPIO 2) of the NodeMCU.
Light (Solar): Connect one terminal to pin D4 (GPIO 4) of the NodeMCU.


Connections for Arduino Mega 2560:

Temperature Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22):
- Connect the sensor's VCC pin to 5V on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the sensor's GND pin to GND on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the sensor's data pin to any digital pin on the Arduino Mega (e.g., pin 8).

Humidity Sensor (e.g., DHT11 or DHT22):
- Connect the sensor's VCC pin to 5V on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the sensor's GND pin to GND on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the sensor's data pin to any digital pin on the Arduino Mega (e.g., pin 9).

pH Sensor:
- Connect the pH sensor according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, this involves connecting power, ground, and the analog output pin to the Arduino Mega.

16x2 LCD Display:
- Connect the LCD display's VCC pin to 5V on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the LCD display's GND pin to GND on the Arduino Mega.
- Connect the LCD display's SDA pin to the SDA pin on the Arduino Mega (for I2C communication).
- Connect the LCD display's SCL pin to the SCL pin on the Arduino Mega (for I2C communication).

Serial Communication:
- Connect the Arduino Mega 2560 to your computer via USB cable for serial communication and uploading sketches.

Additional Considerations:
- Ensure common ground connections between all components.
- Double-check the pin assignments in the code to match your actual wiring.
- Power the ESP8266 and the Arduino Mega 2560 appropriately (usually via USB or external power supply).
- Place appropriate resistors or level shifters if required for voltage compatibility between components.
- With these connections, your hardware setup should be ready to run the provided code for both the ESP8266 with Blynk and the Arduino Mega 2560 with sensors and LCD.
